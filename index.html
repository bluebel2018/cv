        <h1>Kate Walker</h1>
        <p><em>Dog trainer and author</em></p>
        <p>Kate has been an animal lover her whole life. After graduating from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Zoology, she found she had a passion and an affinity for animal behaviour. As a result, she began
          working
          with guide dog puppies and dogs with particular behaviour issues. Kate currently teaches high school Biology whilst competing successfully all over the country with her agility and trick dog. She teaches foundation dog classes on the
          weekends.
          Her first short story was published in <a href="http://affirmpress.com.au/publishing/it-happened-off-the-leash/">It Happened Off the Leash</a>, a collection of true dog stories. She resides with animals of all shapes and sizes, including 3
          dogs,
          a cat, 2 snakes and a lizard. </p>
